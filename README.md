# expo-analytics-amplitude

> Source code for the deprecated expo-analytics-amplitude package. This module is removed from Expo SDK in SDK 46. There will be no replacement that works with the classic build service (`expo build`) because [the classic build service has been superseded by **EAS Build**](https://blog.expo.dev/turtle-goes-out-to-sea-d334db2a6b60). With **EAS Build** and [Development Builds](/development/introduction.md), you should use the official [@amplitude/react-native](https://github.com/amplitude/Amplitude-ReactNative) instead.

Provides access to Amplitude (https://amplitude.com/) mobile analytics. This module wraps Amplitude-iOS (https://github.com/amplitude/Amplitude-iOS) and Android (https://github.com/amplitude/Amplitude-Android) SDKs.
